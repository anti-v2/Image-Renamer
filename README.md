# üñºÔ∏è Auto Rename Images by AI (Image Captioning)

This small Python script automatically renames your bulk-downloaded images by **looking at the image and generating a smart caption** using AI!  
No more opening each image manually. Just run the script and get meaningful names like `sunset_beach.jpg` or `mountain_view.png` instead of random codes.
